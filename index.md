I am a Professor at the <a href="https://computacao.ufba.br/">Institute of Computing (IC)</a> 
of the <a href="https://ufba.br/">Federal University of Bahia (UFBA)</a> since 1990.  
I was the first Director of Graduate Studies (2014-2017) of the

I hold a PhD degree in Computer Science from the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (2004). 
My research interests include Software Engineering and the following topics: 
technical and social aspects of software ecosystems (architecture, evolution, health and sustainability, practices),
