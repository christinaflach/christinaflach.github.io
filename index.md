## About me 

I am a Professor at the <a href="https://computacao.ufba.br/">Institute of Computing</a> 
of the <a href="https://ufba.br/">Federal University of Bahia</a> since 1990. I hold a PhD degree in Computer Science from the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2004). In 2019, I took a sabbatical leave at Faculty of Computer Science, University of Namur, Belgium.

I was the first Director of Graduate Studies (2014-2017) of the 
<a href="https://computacao.ufba.br/pt-br/programa-de-pos-graduacao-em-ciencia-da-computacao">Computer Science Program (PGCOMP-UFBA)</a>, which offers Masterâ€™s and PhD programs in Computer Science. 

I am the head of the [SEED.br](https://seed-br.github.io/) research group.
Our current research focuses on technical and social aspects of open source software ecosystems (architecture, evolution, health and sustainability, best practices), software engineering education, and (with lively interest) Open Science and research software sustainability.

I've contributed to several conference technical committees, for instance, ICSE 2022 (Committee Member in PC within the Technical Papers-track), OSS 2021 (Committee Member in PC within the Technical Papers-track) ICSA 2020-2022 (Committee Member in PC within the Technical Papers-track), and SBES 2004-2021 (Committee Member in PC within the Technical Papers-track), among others.
